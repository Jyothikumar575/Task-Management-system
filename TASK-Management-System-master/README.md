## Introduction
- Task management system is a demonstration web application developed for team project works where users can manage various tasks within a team easily.
- Developed on Spring Boot(backend) with Angular v7 (front-end) frameworks and MySql database.
- Project is focused primarily on handling document-based projects.
- “User” can be a member of more than Programs. And one program can have any number of User members associated with it.
- This web application is made secure and robust. I have implemented JWT-based Authentication on every APIs.
- The project is in an early stage of development and needs lots of work and bug fixing to make it usable in real life. Still, learners can use this as template and make it functinal application.
- I would be happy to see people contribute and enhance this project.
